# CF ROD MOD
a carbon fiber mod with rods instead of a square x-beam and without the linear rails

THIS MOD IS STILL ALPHA!

This mod is designed to essentially reduce the weight on the x axis of the gantry of a Voron 2.4 by about half. It uses 12mm carbon fiber rods and IGUS bushings. As this mod is still ALPHA, currently 3 version are prepared. 
- compact > rod closer together and the AB joints therefore shorter
- hightower > rods further apart, improving vertical stability, but may have issues with binding of the IGUS as well as torque on the AB joints
- hightower dual rail > using MGN9 rails on the top and bottom of the Y axis, improving stability but also increasing the weight.

Currently pre-testing calculations are ongoing. After those, the most promising mod will be tested. I will update GitHub with results / graphs.
